# I. INTRODUCTION
An air conditioner is a device designed to control and regulate the temperature, humidity and ventilation of a space. In this project, a micro-air conditioner was designed using analog electronic components. The air conditioning system has four main units: control unit, operation unit, sensing unit and display unit. The sensing unit consists of an analog temperature sensor. The sensor measures the temperature and gives a certain voltage value in response to a certain temperature value. The control unit has two subunits. In the set subunit, user can adjust the desired temperature. The difference between the ambient temperature and the desired temperature is determined by difference subunit. In the operation unit, heating or cooling is carried out according to the information received from the difference subunit, and which process is being carried out is indicated using LEDs. The display unit contains an RGB LED to display the ambient temperature and desired temperature. This RGB LED continuously transitions the visible color spectrum from blue to red while displaying temperature readings between 24°C and 40°C.
